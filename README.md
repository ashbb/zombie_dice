Zombie Dice on Green Shoes
=====================

[Zombie Dice](http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/) is a famous tabletop game which was made by Steve Jackson Games.

I learned about it in the forum at [RubyLearning.org](http://rubylearning.org). It was introduced by **April Burba**. 

He said that he ported it to a computer game which was a text based game in Ruby. So cool!

I was inspired to port it in Green Shoes. :)
